#### Statement: All units have the same influence on any given population attribute. 
\

##### Answer: False

The above statement is false. Ideally, no single unit should have a greater influence than other units in the population. But as we have seen before (as in Q3), it is possible for a unit to have a greater influence than others. This could be because "it might be the most interesting unit in the population" (Course Notes, Section 2.2.3)
